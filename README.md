# README

Set this up by cloning the repo and then cd'ing your way into the depot directory.

You'll probably want to make sure you have sqlite3 running.

First you'll want to run `bin/rails db:seed`.

Then run `bin/rails server`, this command -should- put the store up and running at localhost:3000/products

There will be many more updates to this project, and it's not exactly ground-breaking, but it's my first time working with Ruby and Rails.

You can run the test suite by being in the depot directory and running `bin/rails test`!



This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
