# README

Set this up by cloning the repo and then cd'ing your way into the depot directory.

Then run `bin/rails server`, this command -should- put the store up and running at localhost:3000/products

There will be many more updates to this project, and it's not exactly ground-breaking, but it's my first time working with Ruby and Rails.





This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
